# Seasonal Surface Water Monitoring with Remote Sensing

This Jupyter notebook analyzes **seasonal water body changes** in southeastern Australia using **remote sensing data**.

## 🌐 Project Summary

Using Google Earth Engine and Python, this project detects and visualizes surface water variations across **NSW, ACT, and Victoria**. It applies indices like NDWI to Sentinel-2 or Landsat imagery, quantifying changes in water bodies over time.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Earth Engine
- NCI (Gadi HPC) — for processing larger datasets
- NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)

## 📈 Key Features
- Extraction of seasonal water data from satellite imagery
- Time-series visualization of water body fluctuations
- Data smoothing and aggregation over selected regions
- Heatmap generation for spatial water change patterns

## 📊 Sample Outputs
*(Insert screenshots or figures from the notebook if you can)*

## 📁 Files Included
- `Seasonal Water Notebook_Final.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `data/`: (Optional) Source datasets used or preprocessed files

## 🔍 Future Improvements
- Automating region masking
- Adding precipitation overlays
- Deploying as a streamlit dashboard (future version)
